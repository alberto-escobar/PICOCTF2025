# part 1

this chllenge was annoying. so to begin, go to part 2 of the challenge and get the cheese list. When you connect to the program you can encrypt a cheese to get the cipher text and perform a known-plaintext attack.

A cheese you can use is `acorn` then I googled the hinted and deteremined the encrytion is an affine cipher. I used the plaintext-ciphertext pair to find the key using:

then I took the key, and decoded it using the same website.
